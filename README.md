🕹️ Advanced Tic Tac Toe

This is a modern take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

✨ Advanced Feature

Unlike the traditional version, in this game:

The earliest move (whether it's ❌ Cross or ⭘ Circle) vanishes as the game progresses.

This adds a dynamic twist — players must think ahead, since old moves don’t last forever.

The game continues until one player achieves 3 marks in a straight line (row, column, or diagonal).

🎮 How to Play

Player 1 starts as ❌, Player 2 as ⭘.

Take turns placing your mark on the 3×3 grid.

As the game continues, the oldest mark disappears, making the strategy more challenging.

The first to align 3 marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
